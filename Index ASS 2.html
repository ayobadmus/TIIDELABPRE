            <h1>TRIBUTE TO NELSON MANDELA: The Passing Of a Man of Peace</h1>
            <P>Mandela was a man who tirelessly dedicated his life to fighting arbitrariness and injustice.He was imprisoned for <br>
               27 years for his resolute fight against racism and segregation and was a symbol of courage and self-sacrifice in <br>
               the face of oppressive regimes. His isolation allowed those upholding apartheid to preserve a political system <br>
               entirely built upon violence, racial discrimination and inequalities; his liberation marked the inevitable <br>
               dismantling of this system.
            </P>
            <p>Today, in a South Africa that is still characterised by challenges of equality, social justice and security,<br> 
               and in a world where resistance to authoritarianism, discrimination, and the temptation of isolationism <br>
               still holds its place, it is essential to draw inspiration from the immeasurable political, intellectual <br>
               and ideological legacy of this pioneer of modern revolutions. His outstanding contribution to the promotion <br>
               of human rights and democratic principles throughout the world will remain in everyone’s memories.<br>

            <h3><stong>The Embodiment of Universal Struggles</stong></h3>
            <p>“Nelson Mandela was the true embodiment of the legitimate and universal fight against oppression, discrimination,<br>
                racism, colonialism, poverty, conflicts. He will forever remain an extraordinary inspiration for all those who <br>
                defend democratic principles and universality of human rights,” declared Karim Lahidji, FIDH President.<br>
                “LHR mourns the loss and celebrates the life of South Africa’s greatest icon. As a human rights lawyer, <br>
                Nelson Mandela led the struggle against Apartheid. As a statesman he remained committed to the <br>
                principles of justice and integrity. Madiba’s life is a source of inspiration to a new <br>
                generation of lawyers who see the law as an instrument for change,” declared Jacob Van Garderen, <br>
                LHR National Director (South Africa).

            <h3><strong>The Symbol of Transformation </strong></h3>
            <p>“Mandela symbolised ubuntu and the strength of principles, in the face of oppression. His courage and <br>
                determination showed us how, in the face of injustice, we should never give up the struggle for truth,<br>
                fairness and justice. He transformed his society and indeed the world, by living his values” says <br>
                Alice Mogwe, FIDH Deputy Secretary General (Botswana).

            <h3><strong>Laying the Foundations of a Democratic Society</strong></h3>
            <p>“The South Africa under apartheid wanted to establish differences in law, the South Africa under Mandela has<br>
                tirelessly tried to draw its strength from differences. This man of peace, who dedicated his restored <br>
                freedom to found a democratic and multi-racial South African society, never showed hatred or resentment,<br>
                ” declared Sheila Muwanga Nabachwa, FIDH Vice-President (Uganda).<br>
                “Nelson Mandela succeeded in giving a humanistic vision to his political action to reconcile a population<br>
                that had been divided by decades of arbitrariness and discrimination. He is a true model from who our <br>
                present rulers should draw inspiration,” declared Dismas Kitenge, FIDH Vice President (DRC).

            <h3><strong>Promoting Peace and Democracy Beyond Borders</strong></h3>
            <p>"The fight of Nelson Mandela for human rights continued to illuminate the twilight of his life, beyond<br>
                the borders of his country. While many conflicts in Africa continue to claim thousands of victims, <br>
                it is time for our continent to build the foundations of the peace advocated by Mandela,” declared <br>
                Drissa Traoré, FIDH Vice President (Côte d’Ivoire)

            <h3><strong>Standing by the Most Vulnerable</strong></h3>
            <p>“Nelson Mandela’s struggle against social and economic inequalities, for women’s rights, children’s rights,<br>
                and against the stigmatisation of people living with HIV-AIDS, has made of him one of the best ambassadors <br>
                of the voiceless,” declared Paul Nsapu, FIDH Secretary General (DRC).</p>
